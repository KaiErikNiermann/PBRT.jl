\TODO{As a very rough indication, the final thesis report typically entails, excluding appendixes, between 10 and 30 pages, with an average of 15 pages. The large variation depends on many variables including the specific field, project nature, and context. We advise to ask your supervisor if you should consider which number as a reference.}

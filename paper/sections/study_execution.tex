Discuss the execution of your project, the results you obtained, and how they help in addressing the claims you made in the introduction. 
This section can be customised to the specific thesis project. For instance, it can be split in more than one section, with revised titles.
You may also use the evaluation results in this section to justify your design choices or assess the contributions of different aspects  of your design towards the overall goals.

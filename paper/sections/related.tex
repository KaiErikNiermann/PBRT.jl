\section{Related Work}\label{s:related}


\TODO{
Describe here scientific papers similar to your thesis work, both in terms of goal and methodology. One paragraph for each paper (we expect about 5-8 papers to be discussed). Each paragraph contains: (i) a brief description of the related paper and (ii) a black-on-white description about how your work differs from, or overlaps with, the related paper, hence emphasizing the novelty contributed by this thesis. You may place this section immediately after the Background section, if necessary.

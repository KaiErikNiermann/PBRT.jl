    An issue with the current approach:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Requires providing all derived types to each getter/setter pair.
      \item Leads to significant overhead and potential errors.
    \end{itemize}
    \pause 
    Preferable solution:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Define the set of derived types once.
      \item Allow all setters for attributes of a class to access this information.
    \end{itemize}

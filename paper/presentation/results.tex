\begin{frame}{Results and Takeaways}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Different language APIs have varied integration approaches.
        \item Adapting APIs to specific use cases is generally manageable depending on the language
        \item Metaprogramming is effective for implementing generic, extensible interop libraries.
        \item Performance overhead can depends alot on language compatability and paradigms
        \item APIs work well for benchmarking and testing components in isolation
        \item Careful consideration needed for using these APIs in performance-dependent production code.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Results and Takeaways}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Different language APIs have varied integration approaches.
        \item Adapting APIs to specific use cases is generally manageable depending on the language
        \item Metaprogramming is effective for implementing generic, extensible interop libraries.
        \item Performance overhead mainly due to language incompatibilities.
        \item Mitigation possible with languages using similar execution methods.
        \item APIs work well for testing components.
        \item Careful consideration needed for using these APIs in performance-dependent production code.

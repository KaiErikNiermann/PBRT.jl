\begin{frame}{Isolated Performance - RQ3}
        \textbf{Results}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item C++ outperforms Julia and Python in component runtime.
            \item Substantial overhead from Julia API (dynamic dispatch, type inference).
            \item Julia performs well with type stability, hindered by cross-language calls.
        \end{itemize}

        \textbf{Conclusion}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item High-performance interop between different languages is challenging.
            \item Effective on a smaller scale, but less viable for very different languages.
        \end{itemize}

binding / blue code implementations
- binding
    - wrappers that allow you to use something in a target language
- binding construction (metadata phase)
    - since we need some representation of the types in both languages
    - so the question is how do we generate these bindings
    - automatically
        - we parse the headers
            - frontend compiler tools (clang AST parser)
            - alot more difficult to work with as we only need a very restricted portion of the ast, that is we just need the header information
            => manually implemented header parsers (crubit I think)
            - easier to implement and apply in our binding generation tool but also means we have to basically reimplement existing frontend tooling
        - we use code reflection
            - languages which implement strong reflection systems (AKA python)
            - reflect on the types and extract runtime type metadata to generat bindings for target language
            - **issues**:
                - reflection is not supported in many languages
                - many languages arent even designed to ever really accomodate it properly,
                - additionaly reflections systems can potentially not provide enough or just not the right information needed
                - examples: Python, Java, C#
    - manual specification
        - we can manually specificy the bindings
	- example: Boost.python (pybind11, CxxWrap) use manual specifications and then code generation from the specifications
        - issue: obvious fact that it requires manual specification
        - benefit: we dont need to work with parsers at all, i mean idfk im not gonna enmerate on everything
